# Data Visualizations
To list some examples of using Python Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in producing informative data visualization

## Scripts 
### [Game.py](Scripts/Game.py)
It produces an adapted bar chart that involves two categorical variables (matches and teams) and one quantitative variable (goals). 
### [Temperatures.py](Scripts/Temperatures.py)
It is based on a real [data set](Data/Temperatures.csv) that was was extracted for a project in the [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) and contains the yearly Riyadh and global temperatures between 1848 and 2013. The results are two time-series chars. Each uses one categorical variable (Riyadh vs the globe) and two quantitative variables (years and temperatures). On the second chart, however, the 10-year moving averages were used to smooth out the data. 
### [Insulin.py](Scripts/Insulin.py)
It is demonstrates the primary visualizations for univariate and bivariate analysis producing five different charts: bar chart, histogram, scatter plot, clustered bar chart and box plot. The data set is not real. It was generated to consist of the data of 700 diabetic patients. 350 patients are from the Middle East countries while the rest are from East Asia. For each patient, the type of diabetes (type 1 or type), the age at diagnosis, the weight and the insulin dose are recorded.
